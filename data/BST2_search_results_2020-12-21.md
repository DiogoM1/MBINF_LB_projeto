web_address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33195401/

## Abstract

Zinc plays a crucial role in the process of virion maturation inside the host cell. The accessory Cys-rich proteins expressed in SARS-CoV-2 by genes ORF7a and ORF8 are likely involved in zinc binding and in interactions with cellular antigens activated by extensive disulfide bonds. In this report we provide a proof of concept for the feasibility of a structural study of orf7a and orf8 proteins. A conceivable hypothesis is that lack of cellular zinc, or substitution thereof, might lead to a significant slowing down of viral maturation.

## Abstract

Prevention of kidney fibrosis is an essential requisite for effective therapy in preventing chronic kidney disease (CKD). Here, we identify Old astrocyte specifically induced substance (OASIS)/cAMP responsive element-binding protein 3-like 1 (CREB3l1), a CREB/ATF family transcription factor, as a candidate profibrotic gene that drives the final common pathological step along the fibrotic pathway in CKD. Although microarray data from diseased patient kidneys and fibrotic mouse model kidneys both exhibit OASIS/Creb3l1 upregulation, the pathophysiological roles of OASIS in CKD remains unknown. Immunohistochemistry revealed that OASIS protein was overexpressed in human fibrotic kidney compared with normal kidney. Moreover, OASIS was upregulated in murine fibrotic kidneys, following unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), resulting in an increase in the number of OASIS-expressing pathological myofibroblasts. In vitro assays revealed exogenous TGF-β1 increased OASIS expression coincident with fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and OASIS contributed to TGF-β1-mediated myofibroblast migration and increased proliferation. Significantly, in vivo kidney fibrosis induced via UUO or ischemia/reperfusion injury was ameliorated by systemic genetic knockout of OASIS, accompanied by reduced myofibroblast proliferation. Microarrays revealed that the transmembrane glycoprotein Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (Bst2) expression was reduced in OASIS knockout myofibroblasts. Interestingly, a systemic anti-Bst2 blocking antibody approach attenuated kidney fibrosis in normal mice but not in OASIS knockout mice after UUO, signifying Bst2 functions downstream of OASIS. Finally, myofibroblast-restricted OASIS conditional knockouts resulted in resistance to kidney fibrosis. Taken together, OASIS in myofibroblasts promotes kidney fibrosis, at least in part, via increased Bst2 expression. Thus, we have identified and demonstrated that OASIS signaling is a novel regulator of kidney fibrosis.

## Abstract

The recent pandemic of coronavirus infectious illness 2019 (COVID19) triggered by SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread around the globe, generating in severe events an acute, highly lethal pneumonia and death. In the past two hitherto similar CoVs, the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) also gained universal attention as they produced clinical symptoms similar to those of SARS-CoV-2 utilizing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) to go into the cells. COVID-19 may also present with overtly neurological symptoms. The proper understanding of the expression and dissemination of ACE2 in central and peripheral nerve systems is crucial to understand better the neurological morbidity caused by COVID-19. Using the STRING bioinformatic tool and references through text mining tools associated to Coronaviruses, we identified SAMHD1 as the probable link to neurological symptoms. Paralleled to the response to influenza A virus and, specifically, respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV-2 evokes a response that needs robust induction of a subclass of cytokines, including the Type I and, obviously, Type III interferons as well as a few chemokines. We correlate ACE2 to the pathogenesis and neurologic complications of COVID-19 and found that SAMHD1 links to NF-κB pathway. No correlation was found with other molecules associated with Coronavirus infection, including ADAR, BST2, IRF3, IFITM3, ISG15, MX1, MX2, RNASEL, RSAD2, and VPRBP. We suggest that SAMHD1 is the molecule that may be behind the mechanisms of the neurological complications associated with COVID-19.

## Abstract

The frequency and functions of Th17-polarized CCR6<sup>+</sup>RORyt<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are rapidly compromised upon HIV infection and are not restored with long-term viral suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART). In line with this, Th17 cells represent selective HIV-1 infection targets mainly at mucosal sites, with long-lived Th17 subsets carrying replication-competent HIV-DNA during ART. Therefore, novel Th17-specific therapeutic interventions are needed as a supplement of ART to reach the goal of HIV remission/cure. Th17 cells express high levels of <i>peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma</i> (PPARy), which acts as a transcriptional repressor of the HIV provirus and the <i>rorc</i> gene, which encodes for the Th17-specific master regulator RORyt. Thus, we hypothesized that the pharmacological inhibition of PPARy will facilitate HIV reservoir reactivation while enhancing Th17 effector functions. Consistent with this prediction, the PPARy antagonist T0070907 significantly increased HIV transcription (cell-associated HIV-RNA) and RORyt-mediated Th17 effector functions (IL-17A). Unexpectedly, the PPARy antagonism limited HIV outgrowth from cells of ART-treated people living with HIV (PLWH), as well as HIV replication <i>in vitro</i>. Mechanistically, PPARy inhibition in CCR6<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells induced the upregulation of transcripts linked to Th17-polarisation (RORyt, STAT3, BCL6 IL-17A/F, IL-21) and HIV transcription (NCOA1-3, CDK9, HTATIP2). Interestingly, several transcripts involved in HIV-restriction were upregulated (Caveolin-1, TRIM22, TRIM5α, BST2, miR-29), whereas HIV permissiveness transcripts were downregulated (CCR5, furin), consistent with the decrease in HIV outgrowth/replication. Finally, PPARy inhibition increased intracellular HIV-p24 expression and prevented BST-2 downregulation on infected T cells, suggesting that progeny virion release is restricted by BST-2-dependent mechanisms. These results provide a strong rationale for considering PPARy antagonism as a novel strategy for HIV-reservoir purging and restoring Th17-mediated mucosal immunity in ART-treated PLWH.

## Abstract

A deficient interferon response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been implicated as a determinant of severe COVID-19. To identify the molecular effectors that govern interferon control of SARS-CoV-2 infection, we conducted a large-scale gain-of-function analysis that evaluated the impact of human interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) on viral replication. A limited subset of ISGs were found to control viral infection, including endosomal factors that inhibited viral entry, nucleic acid binding proteins that suppressed viral RNA synthesis, and a highly enriched cluster of ER and Golgi-resident ISGs that inhibited viral translation and egress. These included the type II integral membrane protein BST2/tetherin, which was found to impede viral release, and is targeted for immune evasion by SARS-CoV-2 Orf7a protein. Overall, these data define the molecular basis of early innate immune control of viral infection, which will facilitate the understanding of host determinants that impact disease severity and offer potential therapeutic strategies for COVID-19.

## Abstract

Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2) is considered as a transmembrane glycoprotein and plays essential roles in innate immunity. It has been recently reported that up-regulation of BST2 was associated with the development of breast carcinoma. However, the clinical significance of BST2 in glioma has not been identified. The purpose of the present study is to explore the expression pattern and the role of BST2 in the progression of high-grade glioma.

## Abstract

A significant proportion of HIV-2-infected patients exhibit natural virological control that is generally absent from HIV-1-infected patients. Along with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, HIV-1 targets macrophages which may contribute to viral spreading and the latent reservoir. We have studied the relationship between macrophages and HIV-2, focusing on post-entry steps. HIV-2-infected monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) produced substantial amounts of viral particles that were largely harbored intracellularly. New viruses assembled at the limiting membrane of internal compartments similar to virus-containing compartments (VCCs) described for HIV-1. VCCs from MDMs infected with either virus shared protein composition and morphology. Strikingly, HIV-2 Gag was mostly absent from the cytosol and almost exclusively localized to the VCCs, whereas HIV-1 Gag was distributed in both locations. Ultrastructural analyses of HIV-2-infected MDMs revealed the presence of numerous VCCs containing both immature and mature particles in the lumen. HIV-2 particles produced <i>de novo</i> by MDMs were poorly infectious in reporter cells and in transmission to activated T cells through a process that appeared independent of BST2 restriction. Rather than being involved in viral spreading, HIV-2-infected macrophages may represent a cell-associated source of viral antigens that can participate in the immune control of HIV-2 infection.

## Abstract

BST2 is a single-pass type II transmembrane (TM) protein, which has a cytoplasmic domain, a transmembrane domain, and an extracellular domain, each domain is important for biologic function of BST2. BST2 is a host restriction factor that can effectively inhibit retrovirus release. Rhesus monkeys are considered as relevant natural animal models for studying AIDS in humans. In order to recognize rhesus BST2 (RhBST2) protein and detect its function accurately, we prepared a polyclonal antibody (pAb) especially for RhBST2. Meanwhile, we constructed RhBST2 proteins with the addition of an HA-tag at the N-terminus (RhBST2-NHA) or inside of the ectodomain (RhBST2-IHA) to compare the recognition ability of rabbit anti-RhBST2 pAb and anti-HA mAb. The results showed that the anti-HA mAb and rabbit anti-RhBST2 pAb had the same ability to identify RhBST2. RhBST2 demonstrated antiviral activity and the ability to activate NF-κB. Moreover, the N-glycosylation states, cell surface level and intracellular localization of RhBST2 were detected. However, HA tags relatively changed part of the biological function of RhBST2. These results show that the RhBST2 polyclonal antibody is more suitable for analyzing the properties and functions of RhBST2, and the natural domain of RhBST2 is very important for its function.

# Inhibition of African Swine Fever Virus Replication by Porcine Type I and Type II Interferons.

web_address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32655518/

## Abstract

Interferons (IFNs) are proteins produced by a variety of cells during the process of virus infection. It can activate the transcription of multiple functional genes in cells, regulate the synergistic effect of multiple signaling pathways, and mediate a variety of biological functions such as antiviral activity and immune regulation. The symptoms of hosts infected with African swine fever virus (ASFV) depend on the combined interaction between viruses and the host. However, it is unclear whether IFNs can be used as an emergency preventive treatment for ASFV. This study focused on the use of recombinant porcine IFNs, produced by <i>Escherichia coli</i>, to inhibit the replication of ASFV. The activity of IFN against ASFV was detected using primary alveolar macrophages at different doses through immunofluorescence assays and quantitative real-time PCR. We found that both 1000 and 100 U/mL doses significantly inhibited the replication of ASFV. Meanwhile, we found that IFNs could significantly trigger the production of a variety of IFN-induced genes (<i>IFIT1</i>, <i>IFITM3</i>, <i>Mx-1</i>, <i>OASL</i>, <i>ISG15</i>, <i>PKR</i>, <i>GBP1</i>, <i>Viperin</i>, <i>BST2, IRF-1</i>, and <i>CXCL10</i>) and MHC molecules, which play key roles in resistance to virus infection. Peripheral blood samples were also obtained from surviving pigs treated with IFNs, and the viral load was determined. Consistent with <i>in vitro</i> tests, low-dose (10<sup>5</sup> U/kg) recombinant porcine IFNs (PoIFN-α and PoIFN-γ) significantly reduced viral load compared to that with high-dose (10<sup>6</sup> U/kg) treatment. Our results suggest that recombinant porcine IFNs have high antiviral activity against ASFV, providing a new strategy for the prevention of African swine fever.

web_address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32595622/

## Abstract

Human BCA2/RNF115/Rabring7 (hBCA2) is a RING type E3 ubiquitin ligase with the ability of autoubiquitination or promoting protein ubiquitination. It also acts as a host restriction factor has BST2-dependent and BST2-independent antiviral activity to inhibit the release of HIV-1. In a previous study, we demonstrated that feline BCA2 (fBCA2) also has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, although its antiviral mechanism remained unclear. In this study, we showed that fBCA2 can interact with feline BST2 (fBST2) and exhibits an fBST2-independent antiviral function, and the RING domain is necessary for the antiviral activity of fBCA2. fBCA2 could degrade HIV-1 Gag and restrict HIV-1 transcription to counteract HIV-1 but not promote the degradation of HIV-1 through lysosomal. Furthermore, for both fBCA2 and hBCA2, restricting viral transcription is the main anti-FIV mechanism compared to degradation of FIV Gag or promoting viral degradation. Consequently, transcriptional regulation of HIV or FIV by BCA2 should be the primary restriction mechanism, even though the degradation mechanism is different when BCA2 counteracts HIV or FIV. This may be due to BCA2 has a special preference in antiviral mechanism in the transmission of primate or non-primate retroviruses.

## Abstract

The human-specific tropism of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) has complicated the development of a macaque model of HIV-1 infection/AIDS that is suitable for preclinical evaluation of vaccines and novel treatment strategies. Several innate retroviral restriction factors, such as APOBEC3 family of proteins, TRIM5α, BST2, and SAMHD1, that prevent HIV-1 replication have been identified in macaque cells. Accessory proteins expressed by Simian Immunodeficiency virus (SIV) such as viral infectivity factor (Vif), viral protein X (Vpx), viral protein R (Vpr), and negative factor (Nef) have been shown to play key roles in overcoming these restriction factors in macaque cells. Thus, substituting HIV-1 accessory genes with those from SIV may enable HIV-1 replication in macaques. We and others have constructed macaque-tropic HIV-1 derivatives [also called simian-tropic HIV-1 (stHIV-1) or Human-Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (HSIV)] carrying SIV <i>vif</i> to overcome APOBEC3 family proteins. Additional modifications to HIV-1 <i>gag</i> in some of the macaque-tropic HIV-1 have also been done to overcome TRIM5α restriction in rhesus and cynomolgus macaques. Although these viruses replicate persistently in macaque species, they do not result in CD4 depletion. Thus, these studies suggest that additional blocks to HIV-1 replication exist in macaques that prevent high-level viral replication. Furthermore, serial animal-to-animal passaging of macaque-tropic HIV-1 <i>in vivo</i> has not resulted in pathogenic variants that cause AIDS in immunocompetent macaques. In this review, we discuss recent developments made toward developing macaque model of HIV-1 infection.

## Abstract

Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2) is a transmembrane glycoprotein and plays an essential role in innate immunity. Here we firstly found that BST2 expression was significantly elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues. High BST2 was closely related to the larger tumor size and more tumor number. Moreover, HCC patients with higher expression of BST2 had poorer overall survival and BST2 was identified as an independent unfavorable prognosis factor. Finally, we demonstrated that BST2 can promote proliferation capacity of tumor cells. In conclusion, HCC patients with higher BST2 expression were more predisposed to poorer clinical symptoms and unfavorable prognosis.

## Abstract

Downregulation of BST-2/tetherin and CD4 by HIV-1 viral protein U (Vpu) promotes viral egress and allows infected cells to evade host immunity. Little is known however about the natural variability in these Vpu functions among the genetically diverse viral subtypes that contribute to the HIV-1 pandemic. We collected Vpu isolates from 332 treatment-naive individuals living with chronic HIV-1 infection in Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa, and Canada. Together, these Vpu isolates represent four major HIV-1 group M subtypes (A [<i>n</i> = 63], B [<i>n</i> = 84], C [<i>n</i> = 94], and D [<i>n</i> = 59]) plus intersubtype recombinants and uncommon strains (<i>n</i> = 32). The ability of each Vpu clone to downregulate endogenous CD4 and tetherin was quantified using flow cytometry following transfection into an immortalized T-cell line and compared to that of a reference Vpu clone derived from HIV-1 subtype B NL4.3. Overall, the median CD4 downregulation function of natural Vpu isolates was similar to that of NL4.3 (1.01 [interquartile range {IQR}, 0.86 to 1.18]), while the median tetherin downregulation function was moderately lower than that of NL4.3 (0.90 [0.79 to 0.97]). Both Vpu functions varied significantly among HIV-1 subtypes (Kruskal-Wallis <i>P</i> < 0.0001). Specifically, subtype C clones exhibited the lowest CD4 and tetherin downregulation activities, while subtype D and B clones were most functional for both activities. We also identified Vpu polymorphisms associated with CD4 or tetherin downregulation function and validated six of these using site-directed mutagenesis. Our results highlight the marked extent to which Vpu function varies among global HIV-1 strains, raising the possibility that natural variation in this accessory protein may contribute to viral pathogenesis and/or spread.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu enhances viral spread by downregulating CD4 and BST-2/tetherin on the surface of infected cells. Natural variability in these Vpu functions may contribute to HIV-1 pathogenesis, but this has not been investigated among the diverse viral subtypes that contribute to the HIV-1 pandemic. In this study, we found that Vpu function differs significantly among HIV-1 subtypes A, B, C, and D. On average, subtype C clones displayed the lowest ability to downregulate both CD4 and tetherin, while subtype B and D clones were more functional. We also identified Vpu polymorphisms that associate with functional differences among HIV-1 isolates and subtypes. Our study suggests that genetic diversity in Vpu may play an important role in the differential pathogenesis and/or spread of HIV-1.

web_address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32375950/

## Abstract

Bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST-2), also known as tetherin, is an interferon-inducible membrane-associated protein. It effectively targets enveloped viruses at the release step of progeny viruses from host cells, thereby restricting the further spread of viral infection. Junin virus (JUNV) is a member of <i>Arenaviridae,</i> which causes Argentine haemorrhagic fever that is associated with a high rate of mortality. In this study, we examined the effect of human BST-2 on the replication and propagation of JUNV. The production of JUNV Z-mediated virus-like particles (VLPs) was significantly inhibited by over-expression of BST-2. Electron microscopy analysis revealed that BST-2 functions by forming a physical link that directly retains VLPs on the cell surface. Infection using JUNV showed that infectious JUNV production was moderately inhibited by endogenous or exogenous BST-2. We also observed that JUNV infection triggers an intense interferon response, causing an upregulation of BST-2, in infected cells. However, the expression of cell surface BST-2 was reduced upon infection. Furthermore, the expression of JUNV nucleoprotein (NP) partially recovered VLP production from BST-2 restriction, suggesting that the NP functions as an antagonist against antiviral effect of BST-2. We further showed that JUNV NP also rescued the production of Ebola virus VP40-mediated VLP from BST-2 restriction as a broad spectrum BST-2 antagonist. To our knowledge, this is the first report showing that an arenavirus protein counteracts the antiviral function of BST-2.

## Abstract

Gastric cancer is one of the most common types of carcinoma with a threat to global health. MicroRNA-760 (miR-760) was significantly down-regulated in the primary tumour of patients with advanced gastric cancer. However, the role of miR-760 in gastric cancer is still unclear. Herein, miR-760 was down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues. Moreover, miR-760 overexpression and knockdown were conducted in gastric cancer cells (MGC-803 and SGC-7901) in vitro. The in vitro functional assays proved that miR-760 overexpression reduced cell viability, cell cycle, migration and invasion, promoted apoptosis and suppressed MMP activity in MGC-803 cells. Conversely, miR-760 knockdown led to the opposite in SGC-7901 cells. Notably, bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST2) was verified as a target gene of miR-760. MiR-760 mimics down-regulated BST2 level in gastric cancer tissues and in MGC-803 cells, whereas miR-760 inhibitor up-regulated its level in SGC-7901 cells. MiR-760-regulated cell properties through reduction of BST2. In addition, miR-760 inhibited tumourigenesis in a nude mouse xenograft model in vivo. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that miR-760 exhibited a suppressive role in gastric cancer via inhibiting BST2, indicating that miR-760/BST2 axis may provide promising therapeutic target for gastric cancer.

## Abstract

The respiratory epithelium comprises polarized cells at the interface between the environment and airway tissues. Polarized apical and basolateral protein secretions are a feature of airway epithelium homeostasis. Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is a major human pathogen that primarily targets the respiratory epithelium. However, the consequences of hRSV infection on epithelium secretome polarity and content remain poorly understood. To investigate the hRSV-associated apical and basolateral secretomes, a proteomics approach was combined with an <i>ex vivo</i> pediatric human airway epithelial (HAE) model of hRSV infection (data are available via ProteomeXchange and can be accessed at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ with identifier PXD013661). Following infection, a skewing of apical/basolateral abundance ratios was identified for several individual proteins. Novel modulators of neutrophil and lymphocyte activation (CXCL6, CSF3, SECTM1 or CXCL16), and antiviral proteins (BST2 or CEACAM1) were detected in infected, but not in uninfected cultures. Importantly, CXCL6, CXCL16, CSF3 were also detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) from hRSV-infected infants but not healthy controls. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of CEACAM1 against RSV was confirmed <i>in vitro</i> using BEAS-2B cells. hRSV infection disrupted the polarity of the pediatric respiratory epithelial secretome and was associated with immune modulating proteins (CXCL6, CXCL16, CSF3) never linked with this virus before. In addition, the antiviral activity of CEACAM1 against hRSV had also never been previously characterized. This study, therefore, provides novel insights into RSV pathogenesis and endogenous antiviral responses in pediatric airway epithelium.

## Abstract

Novel ethyl 2-(5-aryl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)-acetates 17 and propionates 18, together with their acetic acid 19 and acetohydrazide 20 derivatives, were designed and synthesized using TosMIC chemistry. Biological evaluation of these newly synthesized scaffolds in the HIV-1 Vpu- Host BST-2 ELISA assay identified seven hits (17a, 17b, 17c, 17g, 18a, 20f and 20g) with greater than 50% inhibitory activity. These hits were validated in the HIV-1 Vpu- Host BST-2 AlphaScreen™ and six of the seven compounds were found to have comparable percentage inhibitory activities to those of the ELISA assay. Compounds 17b and 20g, with consistent percentage inhibitory activities across the two assays, had IC<sub>50</sub> values of 11.6 ± 1.1 μM and 17.6 ± 0.9 μM in a dose response AlphaScreen™ assay. In a cell-based HIV-1 antiviral assay, compound 17b exhibited an EC<sub>50</sub> = 6.3 ± 0.7 μM at non-toxic concentrations (CC<sub>50</sub> = 184.5 ± 0.8 μM), whereas compound 20g displayed antiviral activity roughly equivalent to its toxicity (CC<sub>50</sub> = 159.5 ± 0.9 μM). This data suggests that compound 17b, active in both cell-based and biochemical assays, provides a good starting point for the design of possible lead compounds for prevention of HIV-1 Vpu and host BST-2 protein binding in new anti-HIV therapeutics.

## Abstract

Interferon (IFN) plays a central role in regulating host immune response to viral pathogens through the induction of IFN-Stimulated Genes (ISGs). IFN also enhances cellular SUMOylation and ISGylation, though the functional interplay between these modifications remains unclear. Here, we used a system-level approach to profile global changes in protein abundance in SUMO3-expressing cells stimulated by IFNα. These analyses revealed the stabilization of several ISG factors including SAMHD1, MxB, GBP1, GBP5, Tetherin/BST2 and members of IFITM, IFIT and IFI families. This process was correlated with enhanced IFNα-induced anti-HIV-1 and HSV-1 activities. Also IFNα upregulated protein ISGylation through increased abundance of E2 conjugating enzyme UBE2L6, and E3 ISG15 ligases TRIM25 and HERC5. Remarkably, TRIM25 depletion blocked SUMO3-dependent protein stabilization in response to IFNα. Our data identify a new mechanism by which SUMO3 regulates ISG product stability and reinforces the relevance of the SUMO pathway in controlling both the expression and functions of the restriction factors and IFN antiviral response.

## Abstract

Bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2 or tetherin) is a host-encoded, interferon-inducible antiviral restriction factor which blocks the release of enveloped viruses. Few studies have assessed the role of BST2 polymorphisms on HIV-1 acquisition or disease progression in sub-Saharan Africa. This study investigated the frequency of four HIV-1-associated BST2 variants rs3217318, rs12609479, rs10415893 and rs113189798 in uninfected and HIV-1 infected black South Africans. Homozygosity for the rs12609479-A minor allele, previously associated with decreased HIV-1 acquisition risk, was underrepresented in HIV-1 uninfected black South Africans (2%) compared to reference African (9%) and in particular European populations (61%) (p = .047 and p < .0001, respectively). To determine if any of these gene variants influenced HIV-1 control in the absence of antiretroviral treatment (ART), we compared HIV-1 infected ART-naïve progressors [n = 72] and controllers [n = 71], the latter includes elite controllers [EC: n = 23; VL < 50 RNA copies/ml]. Heterozygosity for the rs12609479 SNP (G/A) was enriched in progressors compared to ECs (47.2% vs 21.7%, OR = 3.50 [1.16-10.59], p = .03), while rs113189798 heterozygosity (A/G) showed a strong trend of overrepresentation in ECs compared to progressors (47.8% vs 26.4%, OR = 0.39 [0.14-1.04], p = .07). Heterozygosity for the promoter indel rs3217318 (i19/Δ19) was associated with a faster rate of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell decline in progressors (p = .0134). Carriage of the rs3217318 (i19/Δ19), rs12609479 (G/G), rs10415893(G/A) and rs113189798 (A/G) combined genotype, denoted as i19Δ19 GG GA AG, was associated with significantly higher CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell counts in progressors (p = .03), a finding predominantly driven by the _GG_AG combination. Our data suggest that the possession of select BST2 genotype combinations may be implicated in HIV-1 disease progression and natural spontaneous control.

Dendritic cells (DC), which are involved in orchestrating early immune responses against pathogens, are dysregulated in their function by HIV infection. This dysregulation likely contributes to tip the balance toward viral persistence. Different DC subpopulations, including classical (cDCs) and plasmacytoid (pDCs) dendritic cells, are subjected to concomitant inflammatory and immunoregulatory events during HIV infection, which hampers the precise characterization of their regulation through classical approaches. Here, we carried out mass cytometry analysis of blood samples from early HIV-infected patients that were longitudinally collected before and after 1 year of effective combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Blood samples from HIV controller patients who naturally control the infection were also included. Our data revealed that plasma HIV RNA level was positively associated with a loss of cDC and pDC subpopulations that display high expression of LILR immunomodulatory receptors. Conversely, specific monocyte populations co-expressing high levels of HLA-I, 3 immunomodulatory receptors, CD64, LILRA2, and LILRB4, and the restriction factor CD317 (also known as BST2/Tetherin), were more abundant in early HIV-infection. Finally, our analysis revealed that the blood of HIV controller patients contained in a higher abundance a particular subtype of CD1c<sup>+</sup> cDCs, characterized by elevated co-expression of CD32b inhibitory receptor and HLA-DR antigen-presentation molecules. Overall, this study unravels the modifications induced in DC and monocyte subpopulations in different HIV<sup>+</sup> conditions, and provides a better comprehension of the immune regulation/dysregulation mechanisms induced during this viral infection.

## Abstract

Increasing evidence indicates ATP1B3, one of the regulatory subunits of Na<sup>+</sup> /K<sup>+</sup> -ATPase, is involved in numerous viral propagations, such as HIV and EV71. However, the function and mechanism of ATP1B3 on hepatitis B virus (HBV) propagation is unknown. Here, we demonstrated that ATP1B3 overexpression reduced the quantity of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in supernatants of HBV expression plasmids cotransfected HepG2 cells. Correspondingly, small interfering RNA and short hairpin RNA mediated ATP1B3 silencing promoted HBsAg and HBeAg expression in the supernatants of HBV expression plasmids transfected HepG2 cells. Mechanically, we reported that ATP1B3 expression could activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway by inducing the expression, phosphorylation, and nuclear import of P65 for the first time. And NF-κB inhibitor (Bay11) impaired the restraint of ATP1B3 on HBV replication. This counteraction effect of Bay11 proved that ATP1B3-induced NF-κB activation was crucial for HBV restriction. Accordingly, we observed that anti-HBV factors interferon-α (IFN-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production were increased in HepG2 cells after the NF-κB activation. It suggested that ATP1B3 suppressed HBsAg and HBeAg by NF-κB/IFN-α and NF-κB/IL-6 axis. Further experiments proved that ATP1B3 overexpression induced anti-HBV factor BST-2 expression by NF-κB/IFN-α axis in HepG2 cells but not HEK293T cells, and ATP1B3 silencing downregulated BST-2 messenger RNA level in HepG2 cells. As an HBV restriction factor, BST-2 cooperated with ATP1B3 to antagonize HBsAg but not HBeAg in HepG2 cells. Our work identified ATP1B3 as a novel candidate of HBV restrictor with unrevealed mechanism and we highlighted it might serve as a potential therapeutic molecule for HBV infection.

## Abstract

Previously, we detected that 14-3-3 protein epsilon (YWHAE) was involved in the pathogenesis of atopic dermatitis (AD) and tyrosinase-mediated pigmentation. In this study, we aimed to identify critical factors associated with YWHAE in human keratinocytes using high-throughput screening (HTS) approaches to reveal its functions in skin. We overexpressed YWHAE in human HaCaT keratinocytes and then conducted serial HTS studies, including RNA sequencing integrated with antibody arrays and the implementation of bioinformatics algorithms. Cumulatively, these approaches identified several novel genes in keratinocytes associated with the function of YWHAE including KRT9, KRT1, KRT6C, BST2, CIB2, APH1B, ACTC1, IFI27, TUBA1A, CAPN6, UTY, MX2, and MAPK15, based on RNA sequencing data, and MAPK1, MMP2, TYK2, NOS3, and CASP3, based on antibody array data. In particular, CD37 is a unique gene that was detected and validated in all the methods applied in this study. By integrating the datasets obtained from these HTS studies and utilizing the strengths of each method, we obtained new insights into the functional role of YWHAE in skin keratinocytes. The approach used here could contribute to the clinical understanding of YWHAE-associated applications in the treatment of AD disease.

# Resilience of BST-2/Tetherin structure to single amino acid substitutions.

web_address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31183261/

## Abstract

Human tetherin, also known as BST-2 or CD317, is a dimeric, extracellular membrane-bound protein that consists of N and C terminal membrane anchors connected by an extracellular domain. BST-2 is involved in binding enveloped viruses, such as HIV, and inhibiting viral release in addition to a role in NF-kB signaling. Viral tethering by tetherin can be disrupted by the interaction with Vpu in HIV-1 in addition to other viral proteins. The structural mechanism of tetherin function is not clear and the effects of human tetherin mutations identified by sequencing consortiums are not known. To address this gap in the knowledge, we used data from the Ensembl database to construct and model known human missense mutations within the ectodomain to investigate how the structure of the ectodomain influences function. From the data, we identified an island of sequence stability within the ectodomain, which corresponds to a functionally and structurally important region identified in previous biochemical and biophysical studies. Most of the modeled mutations had little effect on the structure of the dimer and the coiled-coil, suggesting that the coiled-coil compensates for changes in primary structure. Thus, many of the functional defects observed in previous studies may not be due to changes in tetherin structure, but rather, due to in changes in protein-protein interactions or in aspects of tetherin not currently understood. The lack of structural effects by mutations known to decrease function further illustrates the need for more study of the structure-function connection for this system. Finally, apparent flexibility in tetherin sequence may allow for greater anti-viral activities with a larger number of viruses by reducing specific interactions with anti-tetherin proteins, while maintaining virus restriction.

## Abstract

The CRISPR technology not only can knock out target genes by using the RNA-guided Cas9 nuclease but also can activate their expression when a nuclease-deficient Cas9 (dCas9) is employed. Using the latter function, we here show the effect of the CRISPR-mediated pinpoint activation of endogenous expression of BST-2 (also known as tetherin), a virus restriction factor with a broad antiviral spectrum. Single-guide RNA (sgRNA) sequences targeting the BST-2 promoter were selected by promoter assays. Potential sgRNAs and dCas9 fused to the VP64 transactivation domain, along with an accessory transcriptional activator complex, were introduced into cells by lentiviral transduction. Increased expression of BST-2 mRNA in transduced cells was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Cells in which BST-2 expression was highly enhanced showed the effective inhibition of HIV-1 production and replication even in the presence of the viral antagonist Vpu against BST-2. These findings confirm that the physiological stoichiometry between host restriction factors and viral antagonists may determine the outcome of the battle with viruses.

## Abstract

Chromobox 6 (CBX6) is a subunit of Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) that mediates epigenetic gene repression and acts as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in a cancer type-dependent manner. The specific function of CBX6 in breast cancer is currently undefined. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset led to the identification of CBX6 as a consistently downregulated gene in breast cancer. We provided evidence showing enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) negatively regulated CBX6 expression in a Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-dependent manner. Exogenous overexpression of CBX6 inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest along with suppression of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro. Microarray analyses revealed that CBX6 governs a complex gene expression program. Moreover, CBX6 induced significant downregulation of bone marrow stromal cell antigen-2 (BST2), a potential therapeutic target, via interactions with its promoter region. Our collective findings support a tumor suppressor role of CBX6 in breast cancer.

## Abstract

Bone marrow stromal antigen 2 (BST-2) mediates various facets of cancer progression and metastasis. Here, we show that BST-2 is linked to poor survival in invasive breast cancer patients as its expression positively correlates with disease severity. However, the mechanisms that drive the pro-metastatic functions of BST-2 are not fully understood. Correlation of BST-2 expression and tumor aggressiveness was analyzed in human tissue samples. Migration, invasion, and competitive experimental metastasis assays were used to measure the cellular responses after silencing BST-2 expression. Using a mouse model of breast cancer, we show that BST-2 promotes metastasis independent of the primary tumor. Additional experiments show that suppression of BST-2 renders non-adherent cancer cells non-viable by sensitizing cells to anoikis. Embedment of cancer cells in basement membrane matrix reveals that silencing BTS-2 expression inhibits invadopodia formation, extracellular matrix degradation, and subsequent cell invasion. Competitive experimental pulmonary metastasis shows that silencing BST-2 reduces the numbers of viable circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and decreases the efficiency of lung colonization. Our data define a previously unknown function for BST-2 in the i) formation of invadopodia, ii) degradation of extracellular matrix, and iii) protection of CTCs from hemodynamic stress. We believe that physical (tractional forces) and biochemical (ECM type/composition) cues may control BST-2's role in cell survival and invadopodia formation. Collectively, our findings highlight BST-2 as a key factor that allows cancer cells to invade, survive in circulation, and at the metastatic site.

## Abstract

Aberrant DNA methylation is a potential mechanism underlying the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Thus, identification of prognostic DNA methylation markers and understanding the related molecular functions may offer a new perspective on CRC pathogenesis. To that end, we explored DNA methylation profile changes in CRC subtypes based on the microsatellite instability (MSI) status through genome-wide DNA methylation profiling analysis. Of 34 altered genes, three hypermethylated (epidermal growth factor, <i>EGF</i>; carbohydrate sulfotransferase 10, <i>CHST10</i>; ependymin related 1, <i>EPDR1</i>) and two hypomethylated (bone marrow stromal antigen 2, <i>BST2</i>; Rac family small GTPase 3, <i>RAC3</i>) candidates were further validated in CRC patients. Based on quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (Q-MSP), <i>EGF</i>, <i>CHST10</i> and <i>EPDR1</i> showed higher hypermethylated levels in CRC tissues than those in adjacent normal tissues, whereas <i>BST2</i> showed hypomethylation in CRC tissues relative to adjacent normal tissues. Additionally, among 75 CRC patients, hypermethylation of <i>CHST10</i> and <i>EPDR1</i> was significantly correlated with the MSI status and a better prognosis. Moreover, <i>EPDR1</i> hypermethylation was significantly correlated with node negativity and a lower tumor stage as well as with mutations in B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase <i>(BRAF</i>) and human transforming growth factor beta receptor 2 (<i>TGFβR2</i>). Conversely, a negative correlation between the mRNA expression and methylation levels of <i>EPDR1</i> in CRC tissues and cell lines was observed, revealing that DNA methylation has a crucial function in modulating <i>EPDR1</i> expression in CRC cells. <i>EPDR1</i> knockdown by a transient small interfering RNA significantly suppressed invasion by CRC cells, suggesting that decreased EPDR1 levels may attenuate CRC cell invasion. These results suggest that DNA methylation-mediated <i>EPDR1</i> epigenetic silencing may play an important role in preventing CRC progression.

# βTrCP is Required for HIV-1 Vpu Modulation of CD4, GaLV Env, and BST-2/Tetherin.

search_keywords: ['function']

web_address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30347660/

## Abstract

The Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) accessory protein Vpu modulates numerous proteins, including the host proteins CD4 and BST-2/tetherin. Vpu interacts with the Skp, Cullin, F-Box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase through interactions with the F-Box protein βTrCP (1 and/or 2). This interaction is dependent on phosphorylation of S<sup>52,56</sup> in Vpu. Mutation of S<sup>52,56</sup>, or inhibition of the SCF, abolishes most Vpu activity against CD4 and partly reduces activity against BST-2/tetherin. Recently, Vpu has also been reported to interact with the clathrin adapter proteins AP-1 and AP-2, and these interactions were also found to be required for BST-2/tetherin antagonism in an S<sup>52,56</sup> -dependent manner. In assays where HIV-1 is pseudotyped with gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV Env), Vpu has also been found to prevent GaLV Env from being incorporated into viral particles, but the mechanism for this antagonism is not fully understood. To clarify the role of the βTrCPs in Vpu function we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate a clonal cell line lacking both βTrCP-1 and -2. Vpu activity against CD4 and GaLV Env was abolished in this cell line, and activity against BST-2/tetherin reduced significantly. Mutation of the S<sup>52,56</sup> residues no longer affected Vpu activity against BST-2/tetherin in this cell line. These data suggest that the primary role of the S<sup>52,56</sup> residues in antagonism of CD4, GaLV Env, and BST-2/tetherin is to recruit the SCF/βTrCP ubiquitin ligase.

## Abstract

BST-2 is an antiviral protein described as a powerful cross-species transmission barrier for simian immunodeficiency viruses. Influenza viruses appear to interact with BST-2, raising the possibility that BST-2 may be a barrier for cross-species transmission. An MDCK-based cell line expressing human BST-2 was generated to study human-derived A/Puerto Rico/8/36 (H1N1; PR8) as well as two low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (subtypes H4N6 and H6N1). The H4N6 and H6N1 viruses were less affected by BST-2 expression than PR8, due to their ability to decrease BST-2 levels, a function localized to the PA segment of both avian viruses. Experiments with PA-mutant and -chimeric viruses confirmed that the avian PA segment conferred BST-2 downregulation and antagonism. These results indicate a species-specific ability of PA from low pathogenic avian viruses to mitigate human BST-2 antiviral activity, suggesting that BST-2 is unlikely to be a general cross-species barrier to transmission of such viruses to humans.

# Limiting Respiratory Viral Infection by Targeting Antiviral and Immunological Functions of BST-2/Tetherin: Knowledge and Gaps.

search_keywords: ['function']

web_address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30113067/

## Abstract

Recent findings regarding the cellular biology and immunology of BST-2 (also known as tetherin) indicate that its function could be exploited as a universal replication inhibitor of enveloped respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, etc.). BST-2 inhibits viral replication by preventing virus budding from the plasma membrane and by inducing an antiviral state in cells adjacent to infection via unique inflammatory signaling mechanisms. This review presents the first comprehensive summary of what is currently known about BST-2 anti-viral function against respiratory viruses, how these viruses construct countermeasures to antagonize BST-2, and how BST-2 function might be targeted to develop therapies to treat respiratory virus infections. The authors address the current gaps in knowledge, including the need for mechanistic understanding of BST-2 antagonism by respiratory viruses, that should be bridged to achieve that goal.

# BST-2 controls T cell proliferation and exhaustion by shaping the early distribution of a persistent viral infection.

## Abstract

The interferon inducible protein, BST-2 (or, tetherin), plays an important role in the innate antiviral defense system by inhibiting the release of many enveloped viruses. Consequently, viruses have evolved strategies to counteract the anti-viral activity of this protein. While the mechanisms by which BST-2 prevents viral dissemination have been defined, less is known about how this protein shapes the early viral distribution and immunological defense against pathogens during the establishment of persistence. Using the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) model of infection, we sought insights into how the in vitro antiviral activity of this protein compared to the immunological defense mounted in vivo. We observed that BST-2 modestly reduced production of virion particles from cultured cells, which was associated with the ability of BST-2 to interfere with the virus budding process mediated by the LCMV Z protein. Moreover, LCMV does not encode a BST-2 antagonist, and viral propagation was not significantly restricted in cells that constitutively expressed BST-2. In contrast to this very modest effect in cultured cells, BST-2 played a crucial role in controlling LCMV in vivo. In BST-2 deficient mice, a persistent strain of LCMV was no longer confined to the splenic marginal zone at early times post-infection, which resulted in an altered distribution of LCMV-specific T cells, reduced T cell proliferation / function, delayed viral control in the serum, and persistence in the brain. These data demonstrate that BST-2 is important in shaping the anatomical distribution and adaptive immune response against a persistent viral infection in vivo.
