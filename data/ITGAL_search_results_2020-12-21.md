## Abstract

In this study we analyzed gene co-expression networks of three immune-related skin diseases: cutaneous sarcoidosis (CS), discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE), and psoriasis. We propose that investigation of gene co-expression networks may provide insights into underlying disease mechanisms. Microarray expression data from two cohorts of patients with CS, DLE, or psoriasis skin lesions were analyzed. We applied weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) to construct gene-gene similarity networks and cluster genes into modules based on similar expression profiles. A module of interest that was preserved between datasets and corresponded with case/control status was identified. This module was related to immune activation, specifically leukocyte activation, and was significantly increased in both CS lesions and DLE lesions compared to their respective controls. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks constructed for this module revealed seven common hub genes between CS lesions and DLE lesions: TLR1, ITGAL, TNFRSF1B, CD86, SPI1, BTK, and IL10RA. Common hub genes were highly upregulated in CS lesions and DLE lesions compared to their respective controls in a differential expression analysis. Our results indicate common gene expression patterns in the immune processes of CS and DLE, which may have indications for future therapeutic targets and serve as Th1-mediated disease biomarkers. Additionally, we identified hub genes unique to CS and DLE, which can help differentiate these diseases from one another and may serve as unique therapeutic targets and biomarkers. Notably, we find common gene expression patterns in the immune processes of CS and DLE through utilization of WGCNA.

## Abstract

The defective MEK/ERK signaling pathway and downstream hypomethylation pattern of lymphocytes are crucial for the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the role that the mesenchymal stem cells play in the MEK/ERK signaling pathway and DNA methylation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from SLE patients remains unknown. In this study, we found that the MEK/ERK signaling pathway of PBMC from SLE patients was activated after the coculture with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) compared with that from the control group. In addition, the expression level of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) increased while the levels of CD70, integrin, alpha L (ITGAL), selectin-l, and IL-13 were reduced in PBMC from SLE patients. However, no obvious effect of BM-MSC on PBMC from healthy controls was observed. These findings revealed that BM-MSC might downregulate the expression of methylation-sensitive genes and then suppress the autoactivated PBMC via the MEK/ERK signaling pathway. And it may be one of the mechanisms that BM-MSC ameliorated SLE.

## Abstract

Granulocytes are an essential part of both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Human neutrophil antigens (HNAs) are a family of epitopes that are located on glycoproteins that are mostly expressed on human granulocytes. Antibodies that recognize these epitopes have been associated with neutropenia, transfusion complications, haematopoietic stem cell transplant nonengraftment and renal transplant rejection. Currently, there are fourteen recognized HNA alleles across five antigen systems (HNA-1 through HNA-5), the molecular basis of which are located on the genes FCGR3B, CD177, SLC44A2, ITGAM and ITGAL, respectively. Elucidation of the associated genes has permitted the development of testing strategies for HNA typing and aided understanding of the associated epitopes. This review will outline the associated clinical conditions that require HNA investigation and how these are performed in specialized laboratories. Investigations provided are both reactive for patients with a variety of existing or suspected neutropenias and proactive in the testing of blood component donors in order to reduce the potential risk to patients who require transfusion.

## Abstract

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is one of the commonest inherited metabolic disorders. Abnormally high level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in blood leads to premature atherosclerosis onset and a high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, the specific mechanisms of the progression process are still unclear. Our study aimed to investigate the potential differently expressed genes (DEGs) and mechanism of FH using various bioinformatic tools.

## Abstract

Human integrin receptors are important for cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion in normal epithelial cells. Emerging evidences have indicated integrin members are involved in cancer development and progression as well. However, the expression patterns and clinical significance of the whole integrin family in ovarian cancer (OC) have not yet been well understood. In the present study, we utilized the public datasets including GEPIA, GEO, ONCOMINE, cBioPortal, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, TIMER databases, to analyze the expression and prognostic value of integrin members in OC. We found ITGA3/B4/B6/B7/B8 were abnormally overexpressed in OC; ITGA6 was good prognosis predictor in OC; ITGA3/ B4/B8 were poor prognosis predictor specially in advanced OC patients; elevated ITGA3/B4 might promote metastasis and elevated ITGA3/B8 might promote platinum resistance of OC; ITGA3 and ITGB4 might synergistically or independently regulate cell adhesion and proliferation; ITGA4/AL/AM/AX/B2/B7 showed strong correlations with various tumor immune infiltrates (TILs), especially with pro-tumor immunes cell types like monocyte, M2 macrophage and exhaustion T cells infiltration; ITGAL/AM/B2/B7 and residing memory CD8+ T cells marker ITGAE were specially associated with early OC patients outcome. Our results implied that ITGA3/B4 were important prognostic markers of advanced OC, ITGAL/AM/ B2/B7 were immune associated prognosis markers of early OC, together they might render important therapeutic targets for OC.

## Abstract

Despite current central nervous system-directed therapies for childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, relapse at this anatomical site still remains a challenging issue. Few reports have addressed the study of the specific cellular microenvironments which can promote the survival, quiescence, and therefore chemoresistance of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells in the central nervous system. Herein, we showed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy that in xenotransplanted mice, leukaemic cells infiltrate the connective tissue stroma of the choroid plexus, the brain structure responsible for the production of cerebrospinal fluid. The ultrastructural study also showed that leukaemia cells are able to migrate through blood vessels located in the choroid plexus stroma. In short-term co-cultures, leukaemic cells established strong interactions with human choroid plexus fibroblasts, mediated by an increased expression of ITGA4 (VLA-4)/ITGAL (LFA-1) and their ligands VCAM1/ICAM1. Upon contact with leukaemia cells, human choroid plexus fibroblasts acquired a cancer-associated fibroblast phenotype, with an increased expression of α-SMA and vimentin as well as pro-inflammatory factors. Human choroid plexus fibroblasts also have the capacity to reduce the proliferative index of leukaemic blasts and promote their survival and chemoresistance to methotrexate and cytarabine. The inhibition of VLA-4/VCAM-1 interactions using anti-VLA-4 antibodies, and the blockade of Notch signalling pathway by using a γ-secretase inhibitor partially restored chemotherapy sensitivity of leukaemia cells. We propose that the choroid plexus stroma constitutes a sanctuary for B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells in the central nervous system. © 2020 The Authors.

web_address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32575815/

## Abstract

The complexity of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) has led to considerable uncertainty in terms of diagnosis and prevalence of the condition. Here, we try to identify the IC/BPS-associated genes through an integrated analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets and confirm experimentally to predict the pathologic diagnosis of IC/BPS. Data mining analysis of GEO datasets (GSE621, GSE11783, GSE28242, and GSE57560) revealed a total of 53 (51 upregulated and two downregulated) common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in IC/BPS. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was then constructed with the 53 common DEGs using Cytoscape v3.7.2, and subsequently, six hub genes (<i>CD5</i>, <i>CD38</i>, <i>ITGAL</i>, <i>IL7R</i>, <i>KLRB1</i>, and <i>IL7R</i>) were identified using cytoHubba v0.1 that were upregulated in IC/BPS. Enrichment analysis of common DEGs revealed that hematopoietic cell lineage, immune system, and T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling in naïve CD4+ T cell signaling pathways were prominently involved with the common 51 upregulated DEGs. The two common downregulated DEGs may enrich linoleic acid metabolism and synthesis of epoxy (EET) and dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (DHET) signaling pathways in IC/BPS. Moreover, our RT-PCR data confirmed that the expression of the five hub genes (<i>CD38</i>, <i>ITGAL</i>, <i>IL7R</i>, <i>KLRB1</i>, and <i>IL7R</i>) was significantly augmented in IC/BPS patients' samples when compared with their normal counterparts. In this study, we systematically predict the significant biomarkers and possible signaling pathways involved in IC/BPS, confirming the differential expression of the hub genes in tissue samples from patients with IC/BPS. Thus, the hub genes might be used as potential diagnostic biomarkers of IC/BPS.

## Abstract

This study was firstly to study the relationship of "ingredient-target-pathway" and the pharmacological effects of <i>Isodon rubescens</i> for the treatment of diabetes. Based on a network pharmacology method, 138 active ingredients of <i>Isodon rubescens</i> were screened from the relative literatures, and their targets were confirmed by comparing these with the hypoglycemic targets in the DrugBank database. Results showed that <i>Isodon rubescens</i> contained 25 hypoglycemic ingredients, such as rabdoternin A, rabdoternin B, and epinodosinol. These ingredients could activate 6 hypoglycemic targets, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), integrin <i>α</i>-L (ITGAL), integrin <i>β</i>-2 (ITGB2), progesterone receptor (PGR), glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), and nuclear receptor subfamily 1 group I member 2 (NR1I2). These targets were involved in 94 signaling pathways, such as the Rap1, PI3K-Akt, and HIF-1 signaling pathways. The cell viability showed that the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with alcohol extract (1.00 g/L) and the water extract (0.13 - 0.50 g/L) exhibited high viability compared to the model group (p <i><</i> 0.05), respectively. 0In animal experiments, the rats treated with water extract of <i>Isodon rubescens</i> showed significant hypoglycemic effects compared to rats in the model group (p <i><</i> 0.05). Overall, this approach provides an efficient strategy to explore hypoglycemic ingredients of <i>Isodon rubescens</i> and other traditional Chinese medicine.

web_address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32260288/

## Abstract

Pegbovigrastim is a commercial long-acting analog of bovine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rbG-CSF) that promotes the increased count and functionality of polymorphonuclear cells in dairy cows around the time of parturition. We hypothesized that pegbovigrastim administered to periparturient cows at approximately seven days before parturition and within 24 hours after calving could affect the profiles of gene networks involved in leukocyte function. Blood was collected on Day 3 after calving from treated groups (pegbovigrastim (PEG); 13 Simmental (seven multiparous and six primiparous) and 13 Holstein (seven multiparous and six primiparous) cows) that received pegbovigrastim (Imrestor; Elanco Animal Health) and controls (CTR; 13 Simmental (seven multiparous and six primiparous) and 13 Holstein (six multiparous and seven primiparous) cows) that received saline solution. Blood from all cows was sampled from the jugular vein in a PAXgene Blood RNA System tube (Preanalytix, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) for RNA extraction. The RT-qPCR analysis was performed to investigate a panel of 34 genes of interest, representing recognition, immune mediation, migration, cell adhesion, antimicrobial strategies, inflammatory cascade, oxidative pattern, and leukotrienes in whole blood leukocytes. Normalized data were subjected to the MIXED model of SAS (ver. 9.4) with treatment, breed, parity, and their interaction as fixed effects. Compared with CTR, whole blood leukocytes of PEG cows had higher expression of genes involved in recognition and immune modulation (<i>CD14</i>, <i>CD16</i>, <i>MYD88</i>, <i>TLR2</i>, and <i>TLR4</i>), cell adhesion (<i>ITGB2</i>, <i>ITGAL</i>, <i>TLN1</i>, <i>SELL</i>, <i>SELPLG</i>, and <i>CD44</i>), antimicrobial activity (<i>MMP9</i>, <i>LTF</i>, and <i>LCN2</i>), and inflammatory cascade (<i>CASP1</i>, <i>TNFRSF1A</i>, <i>IL1B</i>, <i>IL1R</i>, <i>IL18</i>, <i>IRAK1</i>, <i>NLRP3</i>, and <i>S100A8</i>). This suggested an improvement of migration, adhesion, and antimicrobial ability and an enhanced inflammatory response, which in turn could trigger immune cell activation and enhance function. Expression of <i>SOD2</i> and <i>ALOX5</i> was also greater in the PEG group. In contrast, compared with CTR cows, PEG led to lower expression of <i>RPL13A</i>, <i>ALOX15</i>, <i>IL8</i>, and <i>TNF</i>. Overall, leukocytes from Simmental compared with Holstein cows had greater expression of <i>IDO1</i>, <i>RPL13A</i>, <i>ALOX5</i>, <i>CD44</i>, <i>CX3CR1</i>, <i>ITGB2</i>, and <i>TNFA</i>, whereas expression of <i>CD16</i> and <i>TLR2</i> was lower. Overall, compared with multiparous cows, primiparous cows had higher expression of <i>IL1B</i>, <i>IL18</i>, <i>MYD88</i>, <i>SELL</i>, and <i>TLR2</i> and lower expression of <i>MMP9</i>. Simmental cows seemed more sensitive to induction of the immune system after calving, as revealed by the greater abundance of genes involved in immune system adaptation, regardless of pegbovigrastim treatment. Primiparous cows undergoing a new stress condition with respect to older cows were characterized by leukocytes with a higher inflammatory response. In conclusion, pegbovigrastim led to higher expression levels of most genes involved in the processes investigated, suggesting a thorough activation of the immune machinery during the critical post-partum period.

# Functionally Overlapping Variants Control Tuberculosis Susceptibility in Collaborative Cross Mice.

search_keywords: ['generic', 'function']

web_address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31772048/

## Abstract

Host genetics plays an important role in determining the outcome of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> infection. We previously found that Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse strains differ in their susceptibility to <i>M. tuberculosis</i> and that the CC042/GeniUnc (CC042) strain suffered from a rapidly progressive disease and failed to produce the protective cytokine gamma interferon (IFN-γ) in the lung. Here, we used parallel genetic and immunological approaches to investigate the basis of CC042 mouse susceptibility. Using a population derived from a CC001/Unc (CC001) × CC042 intercross, we mapped four quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying tuberculosis immunophenotypes (<i>Tip1</i> to <i>Tip4</i>). These included QTL that were associated with bacterial burden, IFN-γ production following infection, and an IFN-γ-independent mechanism of bacterial control. Further immunological characterization revealed that CC042 animals recruited relatively few antigen-specific T cells to the lung and that these T cells failed to express the integrin alpha L (αL; i.e., CD11a), which contributes to T cell activation and migration. These defects could be explained by a CC042 private variant in the <i>Itgal</i> gene, which encodes CD11a and is found within the <i>Tip2</i> interval. This 15-bp deletion leads to aberrant mRNA splicing and is predicted to result in a truncated protein product. The <i>Itgal<sup>CC042</sup></i> genotype was associated with all measured disease traits, indicating that this variant is a major determinant of susceptibility in CC042 mice. The combined effect of functionally distinct <i>Tip</i> variants likely explains the profound susceptibility of CC042 mice and highlights the multigenic nature of tuberculosis control in the Collaborative Cross.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The variable outcome of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> infection observed in natural populations is difficult to model in genetically homogeneous small-animal models. The newly developed Collaborative Cross (CC) represents a reproducible panel of genetically diverse mice that display a broad range of phenotypic responses to infection. We explored the genetic basis of this variation, focusing on a CC line that is highly susceptible to <i>M. tuberculosis</i> infection. This study identified multiple quantitative trait loci associated with bacterial control and cytokine production, including one that is caused by a novel loss-of-function mutation in the <i>Itgal</i> gene, which is necessary for T cell recruitment to the infected lung. These studies verify the multigenic control of mycobacterial disease in the CC panel, identify genetic loci controlling diverse aspects of pathogenesis, and highlight the utility of the CC resource.

## Abstract

Semen freezability is associated with genetic markers, and there is a diverse set of sperm transcripts that have been attributed to various cellular functions. RNA-Seq was performed to compare the transcript profiles of spermatozoa from boars with different semen freezability. We examined ejaculates from the Polish large white (PLW) boars that were classified as having good and poor semen freezability (GSF and PSF, respectively; n = 3 boars per group) by assessing post-thaw motility characteristics, mitochondrial membrane potential, plasma membrane and acrosome integrity. Total RNA was isolated from fresh spermatozoa from boars of the GSF and PSF groups and subjected to RNA-Seq (Illumina NextSeq 500 platform). Transcript abundance was assessed with the DESeq2, DESeq, and EdgeR Bioconductor R packages, and varying numbers of differentially expressed gene (DEG) transcripts were detected in the spermatozoa of each boar. Using RNA-Seq, we identified several genes associated with inflammation and apoptosis (FOS, NFATC3, ITGAL, EAF2 and ZDHHC14), spermatogenesis (FGF-14 and BAMBI), autophagy (RAB33B), protein phosphorylation (PTPRU and PTPN2) and energy metabolism (ND6 and ACADM) that were predominantly up-regulated in poor freezability ejaculates. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) validated the transcript expression levels detected by RNA-Seq and thus confirmed the reliability of this technique. Subsequent validation with western blotting showed that the expression of three proteins was in accordance with the transcript abundance. Overall, we demonstrated that the up-regulation of the DEG transcripts in spermatozoa was associated with poor semen freezability. We suggest that spermatozoa transcriptome profiling provides a foundation to further elucidate the relevance of sperm-related transcripts on cryo-survival. The sperm-related transcripts, namely FOS, NFATC3, EAF2, BAMBI, PTPRU, PTPN2, ND6 and ACADM, are potential markers for predicting the freezability of boar semen.

## Abstract

<i>Salmonella</i> is an intracellular bacterium found in the gastrointestinal tract of mammalian, avian, and reptilian hosts. Mouse models have been extensively used to model <i>in vivo</i> distinct aspects of human <i>Salmonella</i> infections and have led to the identification of several host susceptibility genes. We have investigated the susceptibility of Collaborative Cross strains to intravenous infection with <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium as a model of human systemic invasive infection. In this model, strain CC042/GeniUnc (CC042) mice displayed extreme susceptibility with very high bacterial loads and mortality. CC042 mice showed lower spleen weights and decreased splenocyte numbers before and after infection, affecting mostly CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, B cells, and all myeloid cell populations, compared with control C57BL/6J mice. CC042 mice also had lower thymus weights with a reduced total number of thymocytes and double-negative and double-positive (CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup>) thymocytes compared to C57BL/6J mice. Analysis of bone marrow-resident hematopoietic progenitors showed a strong bias against lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitors. An F2 cross between CC042 and C57BL/6N mice identified two loci on chromosome 7 (<i>Stsl6</i> and <i>Stsl7</i>) associated with differences in bacterial loads. In the <i>Stsl7</i> region, CC042 carried a loss-of-function variant, unique to this strain, in the integrin alpha L (<i>Itgal</i>) gene, the causative role of which was confirmed by a quantitative complementation test. Notably, <i>Itgal</i> loss of function increased the susceptibility to <i>S.</i> Typhimurium in a (C57BL/6J × CC042)F1 mouse background but not in a C57BL/6J mouse inbred background. These results further emphasize the utility of the Collaborative Cross to identify new host genetic variants controlling susceptibility to infections and improve our understanding of the function of the <i>Itgal</i> gene.

## Abstract

Environmental factors are critical in the development of age-related cognitive decline and dementia. A western diet (WD) can cause nutrient deficiency and inflammation that could impact cognition directly. It is increasingly recognized that innate immune responses by brain myeloid cells, such as resident microglia, and infiltrating peripheral monocytes/macrophages may represent an essential link between a WD, cognitive decline, and dementia. Our previous data demonstrated that chronic consumption of a WD induced inflammation through brain myeloid cells in aging mice and a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the subtypes of myeloid cells that contribute to the WD-induced inflammation remain unclear.

## Abstract

Cluster headache is a severe primary headache characterized by extremely painful attacks of unilateral headache. Verapamil is commonly used as a prophylactic treatment with good effect. In order to search for new pathways involved in the pathophysiology of cluster headache, we analyzed genetic variants that were previously linked to verapamil response in migraine in a Swedish cluster headache case-control sample. We used TaqMan qPCR for genetic screening and performed a gene expression analysis on associated genes in patient-derived fibroblasts, and further investigated which reference genes were suitable for analysis in fibroblasts from cluster headache patients. We discovered a significant association between <i>anoctamin</i><i>3</i>, a gene encoding a calcium-activated ion channel, and cluster headache. The association was not dependent on verapamil treatment since the associated variant, rs1531394, was also overrepresented in patients not using verapamil. No difference was found in the <i>anoctamin</i><i>3</i> gene expression between controls and patients. Also, we determined that <i>TBP</i>, <i>IPO8</i> and <i>PDHB</i> were suitable reference genes in cluster headache fibroblasts. This finding is the first report of an association between a variant in a gene encoding an ion-channel and cluster headache, and the first significant genetic evidence of calcium involvement in cluster headache pathophysiology.

## Abstract

Large‑scale genomics studies have identified recurrently mutated genes in the ETS gene family, including fusions and copy number variations (CNVs), which are involved in the development of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD). However, the aetiology of PRAD remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, 333 driver genes were identified using four computational tools: OncodriveFM, OncodriveCLUST, iCAGES and DrGaP. In addition, 32 driver pathways were identified using DrGaP. SPOP, TP53, SPTA1, AHNAK, HMCN1, ATM, FOXA1, CSMD3, LRP1B and FREM2 were the 10 most recurrently mutated genes in PRAD. ITGAL, TAGAP, SIGLEC10, RAC2 and ITGA4 were the five hub genes in the yellow module that were associated with the number of positive lymph nodes. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the 20 driver genes with the most frequent CNVs revealed three clusters of patients with PRAD. Cluster 3 tumours exhibited significantly higher numbers of positive lymph nodes, higher Gleason scores, more advanced cancer stages and poorer prognosis than cluster 1 and 2 tumours. A total of 48 genes were significantly associated with the number of positive lymph nodes, Gleason scores and pathologic stage in patients with PRAD. The identified set of cancer genes and pathways sheds light on the tumorigenesis of PRAD and creates avenues for the development of prognostic biomarkers and driver gene‑targeted therapies in PRAD.

## Abstract

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a class of non-coding RNA, have been shown to be essential in many diseases, such as infertility. Here, we found three candidate lncRNAs, ENST00000414116, ENST00000433673, and ENST00000448179, that are highly expressed in the uterus endometrial tissues of normal patients compared to the tissues of patients with adenomyosis, endometriosis, and recurrent implantation failure. lncRNAs ENST00000414116 and ENST00000433673 showed high expression in endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) and endometrial epithelial cells (EECs), respectively, and lncRNA ENST00000448179 was specifically expressed in ESCs. The bioinformatics analysis results indicated that the target mRNAs of lncRNA ENST00000433673 were related to biological adhesion. Interestingly, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), an interacting mRNA of the target mRNA integrin subunit alpha L (ITGAL), has been reported be an important regulator of embryo implantation. Further studies found that the target mRNA ITGAL and the interacting mRNA ICAM1 were highly expressed in the uterus endometrial tissues and EECs of normal patients. Based on our results, our study indicates that lncRNA ENST00000433673 might mediate the high expression of the target mRNA ITGAL, thereby promoting the expression of the interacting mRNA ICAM1 and the adhesion of EECs, which facilitates adhesion and implantation between the embryo and the mater.

# Polyamine Metabolism and Gene Methylation in Conjunction with One-Carbon Metabolism.

search_keywords: ['function']

web_address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30309036/

## Abstract

Recent investigations have revealed that changes in DNA methylation status play an important role in aging-associated pathologies and lifespan. The methylation of DNA is regulated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b) in the presence of <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which serves as a methyl group donor. Increased availability of SAM enhances DNMT activity, while its metabolites, <i>S</i>-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) and decarboxylated <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM), act to inhibit DNMT activity. SAH, which is converted from SAM by adding a methyl group to cytosine residues in DNA, is an intermediate precursor of homocysteine. dcSAM, converted from SAM by the enzymatic activity of adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, provides an aminopropyl group to synthesize the polyamines spermine and spermidine. Increased homocysteine levels are a significant risk factor for the development of a wide range of conditions, including cardiovascular diseases. However, successful homocysteine-lowering treatment by vitamins (B6, B12, and folate) failed to improve these conditions. Long-term increased polyamine intake elevated blood spermine levels and inhibited aging-associated pathologies in mice and humans. Spermine reversed changes (increased dcSAM, decreased DNMT activity, aberrant DNA methylation, and proinflammatory status) induced by the inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase. The relation between polyamine metabolism, one-carbon metabolism, DNA methylation, and the biological mechanism of spermine-induced lifespan extension is discussed.

## Abstract

Aberrant CD11a overexpression in CD4+ T cells induces T cell auto-reactivity, which is an important factor for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. Although many studies have focused on CD11a epigenetic regulation, little is known about histone methylation. JMJD3, as a histone demethylase, is capable of specifically removing the trimethyl group from the H3K27 lysine residue, triggering target gene activation. Here, we examined the expression and function of JMJD3 in CD4+ T cells from SLE patients. Significantly decreased H3K27me3 levels and increased JMJD3 binding were detected within the ITGAL (CD11a) promoter locus in SLE CD4+ T cells compared with those in healthy CD4+ T cells. Moreover, overexpressing JMJD3 through the transfection of pcDNA3.1-JMJD3 into healthy donor CD4+ T cells increased JMJD3 enrichment and decreased H3K27me3 enrichment within the ITGAL (CD11a) promoter and up-regulated CD11a expression, leading to T and B cell hyperactivity. Inhibition of JMJD3 via JMJD3-siRNA in SLE CD4+ T cells showed the opposite effects. These results demonstrated that histone demethylase JMJD3 regulates CD11a expression in lupus T cells by affecting the H3K27me3 levels in the ITGAL (CD11a) promoter region, and JMJD3 might thereby serve as a potential therapeutic target for SLE.

## Abstract

Tobacco smoke exposure dramatically alters DNA methylation in blood cells and may mediate smoking-associated complex diseases through effects on immune cell function. However, knowledge of smoking effects in specific leukocyte subtypes is limited. To better characterize smoking-associated methylation changes in whole blood and leukocyte subtypes, we used Illumina 450K arrays and Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) to assess genome-wide DNA methylation. Differential methylation analysis in whole blood DNA from 172 smokers and 81 nonsmokers revealed 738 CpGs, including 616 previously unreported CpGs, genome-wide significantly associated with current smoking (p <1.2x10-7, Bonferroni correction). Several CpGs (MTSS1, NKX6-2, BTG2) were associated with smoking duration among heavy smokers (>22 cigarettes/day, n = 86) which might relate to long-term heavy-smoking pathology. In purified leukocyte subtypes from an independent group of 20 smokers and 14 nonsmokers we further examined methylation and gene expression for selected genes among CD14+ monocytes, CD15+ granulocytes, CD19+ B cells, and CD2+ T cells. In 10 smokers and 10 nonsmokers we used RRBS to fine map differential methylation in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD14+, CD15+, CD19+, and CD56+ natural killer cells. Distinct cell-type differences in smoking-associated methylation and gene expression were identified. AHRR (cg05575921), ALPPL2 (cg21566642), GFI1 (cg09935388), IER3 (cg06126421) and F2RL3 (cg03636183) showed a distinct pattern of significant smoking-associated methylation differences across cell types: granulocytes> monocytes> B cells. In contrast GPR15 (cg19859270) was highly significant in T and B cells and ITGAL (cg09099830) significant only in T cells. Numerous other CpGs displayed distinctive cell-type responses to tobacco smoke exposure that were not apparent in whole blood DNA. Assessing the overlap between these CpG sites and differential methylated regions (DMRs) with RRBS in 6 cell types, we confirmed cell-type specificity in the context of DMRs. We identified new CpGs associated with current smoking, pack-years, duration, and revealed unique profiles of smoking-associated DNA methylation and gene expression among immune cell types, providing potential clues to hematopoietic lineage-specific effects in disease etiology.

## Abstract

Platelet-leukocyte aggregation (PLA) and platelet activation are found to be on the higher side in ischemic stroke patients. The correlation of PLA with clinical features has not been intensively investigated and the influence of genetic factors on PLA is still unexplored. The interaction of platelets with leukocytes is mainly determined by the proteins encoded by six genes: P-Selectin (SELP encodes CD62P) on the thrombocyte binding to P-Selectin-Glycoprotein-Ligand-1 (PSGL1) on the leukocyte, intracellular-adhesion-molecule 2 (ICAM2) interacting with Integrin alpha M (ITGAM) and Glycoprotein 1b-alpha (GP1BA) binding to Integrin alpha L (ITGAL).

# Genome-wide transcriptional and functional analysis of endoglin isoforms in the human promonocytic cell line U937.

search_keywords: ['function']

web_address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25216259/

## Abstract

Endoglin is an auxiliary cell surface receptor for TGF-β family members. Two different alternatively spliced isoforms, long (L)-endoglin and short (S)-endoglin, have been reported. S-endoglin and L-endoglin proteins vary from each other in their cytoplasmic tails that contain 14 and 47 amino acids, respectively. A critical role for endoglin in vascular development has primarily been studied in endothelial cells. In addition, endoglin expression is upregulated during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation; however, little is known about its role in this myeloid context. To investigate the function of endoglin in monocytes, stable transfectants expressing the two endoglin isoforms in the promonocytic human cell line U937 were generated. The differential gene expression fingerprinting of these endoglin transfectants using DNA microarrays and further bioinformatics analysis showed a clear alteration in essential biological functions, mainly those related to "Cellular Movement", including cell adhesion and transmigration. Interestingly, these cellular functions are highly dependent on adhesion molecules, including integrins α1 (CD49a, ITGA1 gene), αL (CD11a, ITGAL gene), αM (CD11b, ITGAM gene) and β2 (CD18, ITGB2 gene) and the chemokine receptor CCR2 (CD192, CCR2 gene), which are downregulated in endoglin transfectants. Moreover, activin A (INHBA gene), a TGF-β superfamily member involved in macrophage polarization, was distinctly affected in each endoglin transfectant, and may contribute to the regulated expression of integrins. These data were confirmed by quantitative PCR, flow cytometry and functional tests. Taken together, these results provide new insight into endoglin function in monocytes.

## Abstract

Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) prevents atherosclerosis and may decrease monocyte/macrophage activation by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Here, we sought to determine the protective effects of DHA against TNF-α-induced stimulation of lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-1 (LOX-1) expression, which is associated with atherosclerosis. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, we found that TNF-α induced the expression of LOX-1 (OLR1), NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2), p47phox (NCF1), very late antigen-4 (ITGA4), and lymphocyte function-associated antigen (ITGAL) genes. Additionally, DHA attenuated TNF-α-induced acetylated (Ac)-LDL uptake and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, as measured using fluorescently labeled LDL and H2DCFDA, respectively, and reduced the expression levels of these genes. Moreover, the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 blocked these effects of DHA. These results indicated that DHA inhibited several events associated with redox regulation in a PI3K-dependent manner, thereby mediating the expression of LOX-1 in monocytes/macrophages. 

# Nr4a1-dependent Ly6C(low) monocytes monitor endothelial cells and orchestrate their disposal.

web_address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23582326/

## Abstract

The functions of Nr4a1-dependent Ly6C(low) monocytes remain enigmatic. We show that they are enriched within capillaries and scavenge microparticles from their lumenal side in a steady state. In the kidney cortex, perturbation of homeostasis by a TLR7-dependent nucleic acid "danger" signal, which may signify viral infection or local cell death, triggers Gαi-dependent intravascular retention of Ly6C(low) monocytes by the endothelium. Then, monocytes recruit neutrophils in a TLR7-dependent manner to mediate focal necrosis of endothelial cells, whereas the monocytes remove cellular debris. Prevention of Ly6C(low) monocyte development, crawling, or retention in Nr4a1(-/-), Itgal(-/-), and Tlr7(host-/-BM+/+) and Cx3cr1(-/-) mice, respectively, abolished neutrophil recruitment and endothelial killing. Prevention of neutrophil recruitment in Tlr7(host+/+BM-/-) mice or by neutrophil depletion also abolished endothelial cell necrosis. Therefore, Ly6C(low) monocytes are intravascular housekeepers that orchestrate the necrosis by neutrophils of endothelial cells that signal a local threat sensed via TLR7 followed by the in situ phagocytosis of cellular debris.

# Suppression of LFA-1 expression by spermine is associated with enhanced methylation of ITGAL, the LFA-1 promoter area.

web_address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23418509/

## Abstract

Spermine and spermidine, natural polyamines, suppress lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) expression and its associated cellular functions through mechanisms that remain unknown. Inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase, which is required for polyamine synthesis, in Jurkat cells by 3 mM D,L-alpha-difluoromethylornithine hydrochloride (DFMO) significantly decreased spermine and spermidine concentrations and was associated with decreased DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) activity, enhanced demethylation of the LFA-1 gene (ITGAL) promoter area, and increased CD11a expression. Supplementation with extracellular spermine (500 µM) of cells pretreated with DFMO significantly increased polyamine concentrations, increased Dnmt activity, enhanced methylation of the ITGAL promoter, and decreased CD11a expression. It has been shown that changes in intracellular polyamine concentrations affect activities of -adenosyl-L-methionine-decaroboxylase, and, as a result, affect concentrations of the methyl group donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and of the competitive Dnmt inhibitor, decarboxylated SAM. Additional treatments designed to increase the amount of SAM and decrease the amount of decarboxylated SAM-such as treatment with methylglyoxal bis-guanylhydrazone (an inhibitor of S-adenosyl-L-methionine-decaroboxylase) and SAM supplementation-successfully decreased CD11a expression. Western blot analyses revealed that neither DFMO nor spermine supplementation affected the amount of active Ras-proximate-1, a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases and a key protein for regulation of CD11a expression. The results of this study suggest that polyamine-induced suppression of LFA-1 expression occurs via enhanced methylation of ITGAL.

# Neutrophil arrest by LFA-1 activation.

search_keywords: ['function']

web_address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22701459/

## Abstract

Lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) is a heterodimeric integrin consisting of α(L) (gene name, Itgal) and β(2) (gene name, Itgb2) subunits expressed in all leukocytes. LFA-1 is essential for neutrophil recruitment to inflamed tissue. Activation of LFA-1 by chemokines allows neutrophils and other leukocytes to undergo arrest, resulting in firm adhesion on endothelia expressing intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs). In mice, CXCR2 is the primary chemokine receptor involved in triggering neutrophil arrest, and it does so through "inside-out" activation of LFA-1. CXCR2 signaling induces changes in LFA-1 conformation that are coupled to affinity upregulation of the ligand-binding headpiece (extended with open I domain). Unlike naïve lymphocytes, engagement of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) on neutrophils stimulates a slow rolling behavior that is mediated by LFA-1 in a distinct activation state (extended with closed I domain). How inside-out signaling cascades regulate the structure and function of LFA-1 is being studied using flow chambers, intravital microscopy, and flow cytometry for ligand and reporter antibody binding. Here, we review how LFA-1 activation is regulated by cellular signaling and ligand binding. Two FERM domain-containing proteins, talin-1 and Kindlin-3, are critical integrin co-activators and have distinct roles in the induction of LFA-1 conformational rearrangements. This review integrates these new results into existing models of LFA-1 activation.

## Abstract

We previously observed the lungs of naive BALB/cJ Cftr(tm1UNC) mice to have greater numbers of lymphocytes, by immunohistochemical staining, than did BALB wild type littermates or C57BL/6J Cftr(tm1UNC) mice. In the present study, we initially investigated whether this mutation in Cftr alters the adaptive immunity phenotype by measuring the lymphocyte populations in the lungs and spleens by FACS and by evaluating CD3-stimulated cytokine secretion, proliferation, and apoptosis responses. Next, we assessed a potential influence of this lymphocyte phenotype on lung function through airway resistance measures. Finally, we mapped the phenotype of pulmonary lymphocyte counts in BALB × C57BL/6J F2 Cftr(tm1UNC) mice and reviewed positional candidate genes. By FACS analysis, both the lungs and spleens of BALB Cftr(tm1UNC) mice had more CD3(+) (both CD4(+) and CD8(+)) cells than did littermates or C57BL/6J Cftr(tm1UNC) mice. Cftr(tm1UNC) and littermate mice of either strain did not differ in anti-CD3-stimulated apoptosis or proliferation levels. Lymphocytes from BALB Cftr(tm1UNC) mice produced more IL-4 and IL-5 and reduced levels of IFN-γ than did littermates, whereas lymphocytes from C57BL/6J Cftr(tm1UNC) mice demonstrated increased Il-17 secretion. BALB Cftr(tm1UNC) mice presented an enhanced airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine challenge compared with littermates and C57BL/6J Cftr(tm1UNC) mice. A chromosome 7 locus was identified to be linked to lymphocyte numbers, and genetic evaluation of the interval suggests Itgal and Il4ra as candidate genes for this trait. We conclude that the pulmonary phenotype of BALB Cftr(tm1UNC) mice includes airway hyperresponsiveness and increased lymphocyte numbers, with the latter trait being influenced by a chromosome 7 locus.

## Abstract

Long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) migrate from the fetal liver (FL) to the fetal bone marrow (FBM) during development. Various adhesion and chemotactic receptor genes have been implicated in the migration of adult LT-HSCs. However, their role in the migration of fetal LT-HSCs is not clearly understood due, in part, to the rare number of these cells in fetal tissues, which preclude classical gene expression analysis. The aim of this study is to characterize the expression of migration related genes in fetal LT-HSC across different anatomical locations during development.

## Abstract

Demethylation of CD11a (ITGAL; GeneID:3683; HGNC: 6148) and CD70 (TNFSF7; GeneID:970; HGNC:11937) regulatory regions in CD4(+) T cells contributes to the development of autoreactivity and autoantibody overstimulation in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In this study, we present a novel approach for measuring the methylation status of CD11a and CD70 promoter sequences. The procedure combines the standard method of bisulfite conversion of methylated CpG pairs with high-throughput oligonucleotide microarray-based technology that allows for rapid quantification of deoxycytosine and deoxymethylcytosine content in bisulfite-treated DNA samples. The microarrays were first used to generate a standard curve from fully methylated and fully unmethylated DNA samples using a one-dimensional linear regression equation that calculated fluorescence emission as a function of methylation levels. The methylation status of the CD70 and CD11a promoters in SLE and control CD4(+) T cell samples were measured, and the microarray prediction was found to be highly accurate when compared to bisulfite sequencing. Furthermore, the microarrays were able to detect differences in the methylation status between SLE patient and healthy control samples. These results indicate that our new microarray-based assay could prove to be a highly reliable, rapid, and cost effective diagnostic and prognostic test for SLE.

## Abstract

T-cell activation is an essential step of the immune response and relies on the tightly controlled orchestration of hundreds of genes/proteins, yet the cellular and molecular events underlying this complex process are not fully understood, especially at the genome-scale. Significantly, a comparative genome-scale transcriptional analysis of two T-cell subsets (CD4+ and CD8+) against each other and against the naturally mixed population (CD3+ cells) remains unexplored.

# Nerve growth factor translates stress response and subsequent murine abortion via adhesion molecule-dependent pathways.

search_keywords: ['function']

web_address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16371592/

## Abstract

Spontaneous abortion is a frequent threat affecting 10%-25% of human pregnancies. Psychosocial stress has been suggested to be attributable for pregnancy losses by challenging the equilibrium of systems mandatory for pregnancy maintenance, including the nervous, endocrine, and immune system. Strong evidence indicates that stress-triggered abortion is mediated by adhesion molecules, i.e., intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) and leukocyte function associated molecule 1, now being referred to as integrin alpha L (ITGAL), which facilitate recruitment of inflammatory cells to the feto-maternal interface. The neurotrophin beta-nerve growth factor (NGFB), which has been shown to be upregulated in response to stress in multiple experimental settings including in the uterine lining (decidua) during pregnancy, increases ICAM1 expression on endothelial cells. Here, we investigated whether and how NGFB neutralization has a preventive effect on stress-triggered abortion in the murine CBA/J x DBA/2J model. We provide experimental evidence that stress exposure upregulates the frequency of abortion and the expression of uterine NGFB. Further, adhesion molecules ICAM1 and selectin platelet (SELP, formerly P-Selectin) and their ligands ITGAL and SELP ligand (SELPL, formerly P selectin glycoprotein ligand 1) respectively increase in murine deciduas in response to stress. Subsequently, decidual cytokines are biased toward a proinflammatory and abortogenic cytokine profile. Additionally, a decrease of pregnancy protective CD8alpha(+) decidual cells is present. Strikingly, all such uterine stress responses are abrogated by NGFB neutralization. Hence, NGFB acts as a proximal mediator in the hierarchical network of immune rejection by mediating an abortogenic environment comprised of classical signs of neurogenic inflammation.

# Induction of IFN-regulated factors and antitumoral surveillance by transfected placebo plasmid DNA.

web_address: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15585412/

## Abstract

Delivery of DNA encoding therapeutic genes in vivo has great potential for treating malignancy as well as genetic diseases. Delivery of placebo DNA without a transgene is used as a control in gene therapy studies. It is tacitly assumed by most investigators that the protein expressed from the transfected DNA has phenotypic consequences, but that the consequences are not from the DNA itself. Here, we demonstrate that transfection of control plasmid DNA (that does not express a gene product) into tumor cell lines induces a dramatic (>10-fold) increase in the expression of the interferon (IFN)-regulated genes IRF7, STAT1, MIG (approved gene symbol CXCL9), MHCI (MICA), and CD11a (ITGAL) in tumor cell lines. Induction of these genes inhibits tumor development and tumor growth in immunocompetent mice that are immunized with apoptotic tumor cells. The antibody depletion study indicates that the underlying mechanism by which transfection of control DNA induces IFN-regulated genes is the induction of a secreting factor(s) such as IFN-beta. Three lines of evidence indicate that DNA transfection-mediated induction of IFN-regulatory genes is independent of TLR9. The three lines of evidence are: (1) TLR9 is not expressed in either SCCVII or 4T1 cell line, (2) activation of TLR9 downstream signaling molecules is not associated with the induction of gene expression, and (3) the secretion factor(s) obtained from the conditioned medium of DNA-transfected SCCVII tumor cells induces the same type of gene expression in the 4T1 tumor cell line, which is refractory to the gene induction by DNA transfection. Our finding indicates that the 4T1 tumor cell line, which is resistant to the DNA transfection-mediated induction of IFN-regulated genes, can be used to determine the real therapeutic gene function.
